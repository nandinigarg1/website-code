<p> The realization resulted in the inception of Meerut Public School in the year 1992. 
It received affiliation from the Central Board of Secondary Education in due course.
The beginning was humble but dreams big,vision farsighted,intentions noble,effort 
unsparing and result laudable. The school grew from strength to strength.
The M.P.S. fraternity saw an expansion of sorts, a feat unaccomplished by any other in the city. 
Cradled in the peaceful ambience of the cantonment,the school caters to the educational need of 
the residents in the vicinity as well as far flung areas.The carefully chosen curriculum imparts
 extensive knowledge of prevalent disciplines. Activities like art, painting, music, dance, elocution
 and dramatics receive as much attention as encouraged to augment class room instructions through
 project work,excursions and trips. Community service is seen as an essential part of education, 
preparing a student to adopt more responsible attitudes as an adult member of society.
<br>
Meerut Public School for is committed to the promotion of education and human values. It strives to seek out the positive, to enhance inherent skills and to empower the physical, emotional and intellectual faculties through comprehensive quality education incorporating global trends with the traditional indian ethos.
