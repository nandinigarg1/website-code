The scholastic session is divided into two terms. Each term ends with a Written Assessment. Marks obtained are recorded in the Result Card. Parents are expected to personally collect the Result Card of their ward on the Result Declaration Day.

First Term:
<br><br>
Duration: April to September 
Mid Term Written Assessment: September 
Second Term: 
Duration : October to March

Apart from the Term Examinations two more periodic tests are held for the purpose of gradient learning of these tests one will be pre-mid term in July and the other post midterm in January with a portion of the syllabus cumulatively covered. The gradually increasing syllabus will prepare the students for appearing in the Final Written Assessment with 100% syllabus. The school will take the average of the best two tests for final marks submission. 
Classes I to V will follow the same examination schedule but the syllabus will be defined by the school.
